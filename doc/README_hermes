		filters support basic queries on both personal rating and favorite value.
			is:favorite shows only favorited fics
			is:rated shows only rated fics
			is:r>5 shows fics with a rating of 6 or more
			is:r=6 shows fics with a rating of 6
			is:f<2 shows fics that are not marked !
		'favorite' and 'rated' can both be abbreviated.

		The tag start can be abbreviated to 'i:' or ':'.

		Relations supported are =, <, >
			~ (subsequence match)
			. (substring match)

		Valid fields for is: tags include:
			favorite, rated, author, description, fandom

		'is:new' is a special tag that shows never opened fics only.
		'is:complete' matches fics that have a Complete write status

		if the filter is a url, only fics that matched the parsed id will be
			shown. If the url contains a chapter id, then the fic will be loaded
			if the info does not already exist in the database.

		if the filter is a generally parseable id, the shown fics will be
			limited to those matching the id. This can be used to open
			`linkffn()` style ids.

	TODO:
		e: get info on current chapter/fic
