There are a few steps required when first getting started with this project.

Depending on whether you plan to run hermes or alexandria (or both) several
python dependencies are required. These can be installed using standard
virtual enviornment management utilities, through pip, or your distributions
package manager. For example:
	python -m virtualenv ./venv_alexandria
	./venv_alexandria/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade pip
	./venv_alexandria/bin/python -m pip install -r alexandria_api_requirements.txt

A postgres db is required. More information about this and how to create the
initial schema can be found in doc/db_setup. There may be environment
variables you need to set so that hermes/alexandria can connect to the correct
db.

As part of the db setup ./schema.py should be run, but in case changes are
made or you lose the store_bases.py file, run it again to generate
store_bases.py.

Copy the priv.ex.py file to priv.py in the root project folder. This contains
secrets that should not generally be committed to the repository. The
`getDefaultCookies` function should not need changed. However, the
`skitterClients` should be set to either an empty list, which will mean any
adapter which uses it will not work, or be filled based on the example given
with credentials to a skitter instance.

Use of skitter is currently required for FFN, FictionPress, and Royal Road.
None of these will work if you do not have a configured skitter instance.

Once these steps have been completed, the doc/README_hermes and
doc/README_alexandria files provide more information about usage.
