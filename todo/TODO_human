	we pre-scraped this entire site

we pre-scraped some multi-chapter and one-shot stories from fictionalley that
need fully imported.

	actually needs trailing slash >_>


a lot of fic_chapters have no url on their first chapter:
	select fc.fic_id, fc.cid, f.type, f.url
	from fic_chapters fc
	join fics f on f.id = fc.fic_id
	where fc.cid = 1 and fc.url is null
this prevented them from being added in the initial hermes -> minerva import,
which means they won't be rescraped by rescrapeOld

All 1st chapters for 1-chapter only fanfiction.net stories have already been
rescraped:
	select url from fics where chapterCount = 1 and type = 2;

	echo 'select url from fics where chapterCount = 1 and type = 2;' \
			| sqlite3 ~/.local/share/hermes/hermes_meta.db \
			| while read -r url; do
		./prescrapeUrl.py "$url" 7.1
	done

need to loop back around and get 1st chapter for multi-chapter ffn works, and
for any other type that is in there
